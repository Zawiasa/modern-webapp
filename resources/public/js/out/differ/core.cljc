  "This namespace has two functions: diff and patch.

  Diff allows you to compare two datastructures, and returns elements that
  are different or non-existant. The result of this comparision is represented
  by a vector containing alterations and removals, respectively.

  Once you have a diff like this, you can apply it to any similar data-
  structure with the patch function. If you only want a diff of alterations,
  or only removals, you can use the alteration and removal functions in the
  differ.diff and differ.patch namespaces."
